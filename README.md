## How to run

Run TypeScript in Deno:

```bash
deno run --allow-read --watch ./2022/01/a.ts
```

this will run and watch of changes the solution for 1st December, 2022

I'm solving most of these prioritizing getting to a working solution as quickly as possible, I may rework some solutions to optimize them for readability and performance, but not always.
